# Micro CPU

Micro CPU project did during Digital Systems discipline on Logisim, consisting in a very simple architecture to do arithmetic operations as it's loaded by a memory file. Some of the memory files tested can be found at this repository's files.

## Circuit Overview

Doing this project was fundamental to learn some basics concepts about computer architecture, such as flip-flops, registers, counters and how a ROM memory works. The arithmetic logic unit was built
